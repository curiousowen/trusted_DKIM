# trusted_DKIM
The Trusted_DKIM Tool is designed to aid penetration testers (pentesters) in assessing and enhancing email security. This tool facilitates the simulation of scenarios involving DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) signatures, which are crucial for verifying the authenticity and integrity of emails.

How It Assists Pentesters:

Email Spoofing Simulations: Pentesters can simulate email spoofing attacks by sending emails that appear to originate from spoofed addresses. The tool signs these emails with valid DKIM signatures, allowing testers to evaluate how well email servers detect and handle spoofed emails with DKIM protection.

Assessment of Email Security Configurations: By sending DKIM-signed emails, pentesters can assess the effectiveness of email security configurations. They can test if email servers correctly validate DKIM signatures and enforce policies based on the authenticity of incoming emails.

Phishing Awareness Testing: The tool can be used to conduct phishing simulations. Pentesters can send DKIM-signed phishing emails to test the awareness and responsiveness of users to potentially malicious emails that appear legitimate due to valid DKIM signatures.

Evaluation of DMARC Policies: DKIM signatures play a crucial role in DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) policies. Pentesters can use this tool to evaluate how email servers and DMARC policies handle DKIM-signed emails, helping organizations strengthen their defenses against email fraud and phishing attacks.

Install the required Python library:

      pip install dkimpy

Usage

Configuration:
Open trusted_DKIM.py in a text editor.
Update the following parameters with your specific values:

            recipient: Email address of the recipient.
            smtp_server: SMTP server address (e.g., smtp.example.com).
            spoofed_sender: Email address to appear as the sender (spoofed).
            sender_domain: Domain of the sender for DKIM signing (e.g., example.com).
            dkim_identity: Identity for DKIM signing (e.g., @example.com).
            dkim_key_path: Path to the DKIM private key file (e.g., /path/to/private_key.pem).
            dkim_selector: DKIM selector associated with the public key (e.g., selector1).
            email_subject: Subject of the email.
            email_content: HTML content of the email.

Running the Script:

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory containing trusted_DKIM.py.

Execute the script:

            python trusted_DKIM.py
